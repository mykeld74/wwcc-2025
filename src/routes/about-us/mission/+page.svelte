						Over and over in the New Testament the church is referred to as the body of Christ, and
						we need to understand what that means. We are His eyes to see a needy world. We are his
						mouth to speak words of grace and truth. We are His heart to love, even the unlovable.
						We are His hands to mend, serve, and reach out. We are His legs and feet to carry His
						message to those who need it!

						In Matthew 28, Jesus gives us the clearest directive that anyone could hope for, saying,
						“Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son,
						and the Holy Spirit and teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you.” This is
						our simple command straight from the mouth of God–“Make Disciples”.

						Christians have stood idle long enough. We don’t want to stand before a nail scarred
						Christ and explain to Him why we never quite got around to the whole making disciples
						thing! We must have, and act on, a sense of urgency–to take seriously His great
						commission and to take personal, as well as shared, responsibility to make sure it is
						getting done!
