<h1 class="pageTitle">Welcome to Women of Westwoods (WoW)</h1>
<p>
	The Women's Ministry of Westwoods is an arm of the church that provides opportunities for every
	woman to connect relationally, be encouraged in their walk with Jesus, and equipped to impact
	their world for the Kingdom. Whether it's through monthly Connect events, mom gatherings, focusing
	on fitness, regular bible study, praying together, holiday events, play dates, service
	opportunities, tea and coffee chats, impromptu fun, mentor meetings or parenting discussions,
	there is a place for YOU! Our hope is that ladies will be encouraged and challenged by doing life
	and building friendships!
